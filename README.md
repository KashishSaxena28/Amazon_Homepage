# Amazon_Homepage
I independently developed a replica of the Amazon homepage using HTML and CSS, focusing on meticulous
attention to detail in layout, styling, and responsive design. This project honed my skills in front-end
development, including structuring content, styling elements, and ensuring cross-browser compatibility. It
demonstrates my ability to translate complex designs into functional and visually appealing web interfaces.
